# Introduction
This is a small project to build something similar to the 'wrapped' pages you see on all the apps and websites nowadays.

It's not expected to look anything like those with the animations or music but just a fun way to relive the year.

# Populating the data
Data can be populated into the SQL Lite database by running

```
python manage.py populate_processes
```
